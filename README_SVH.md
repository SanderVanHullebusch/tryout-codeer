# In mail questions to think about

## What did I found the hardest?

The hardest for me was setting up the project since my own computer is outdated and didn't even want to open the new version of Visual Studio Code.
Besides this technical issue I had to look up a few things about Nest.js since I had never used this framework.

## What took me the longest and how did I solve this?

First I got some technical issues regarding my setup which wasn't compatible. I wanted to look to the commits and downgrade to the latest version, but quickly switched to another laptop which did work like intended.
The longest time was spent on documentation for Nest.js and antd since I didn't know what was possible and what not.
